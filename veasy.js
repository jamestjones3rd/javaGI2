//Write a function named min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum

//Data
let x = 6;
let y = 2;

//Function so I can make the subtraction happen
function min (x , y){
    return x - y
};

//Calling the function with data 
let subtract = min (x , y);

//Calling the result to show in terminal
console.log(subtract);
